      <h4>2020/05/04 - Getting people out of the Matrix  </h4>
      <p>This was a nice week, got some programming exercises to do, convinced my close friends to try secure communication protocols and to get out of social media, I think some of them will even  use GNU/Linux tho lol. </p>
      <p>I actually thought they would think I sound like some tinfoil hat freak, but I guess they like conspiracies too. Hoping some of them will get to at least making websites, because it's really nice having your own place in the Web, but I think actual programming might be a little too far.</p>
      <p><b>And I fucked my sleep schedule again, fuck.</b></p>
