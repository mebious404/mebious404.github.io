      <p> This is my first post, oof. I guess the first thing I want to
        talk about are the reasons why I'm building this website with my poor
        CSS skills. One of them is because I want to learn about developing
        websites and the way the wired work, the other is the idea that everyone
        should have their own personal webpage, built by them, to reflect their
        own ideas and beliefs.</p>
      <p> That's it for today, I guess, I hope that I can make this place nice
        to visit and learn with it.</p>
