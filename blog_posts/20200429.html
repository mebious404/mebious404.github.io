      <h4>2020/04/29 - Journal  </h4>
      <p>I'll try to keep a small journal from now on, I'm not very good at prose though.</p>
      <p>Just find a nice synthwave station today, guess I'll put some .m3u I listen in the archive, the name is Synthetic FM, I prefer darkwave stuff, but it's still nice. I'm finishing that book from Assange, Cypherpunks, really interesting topic, I'll probably read Neuromancer next, the world nowadays really feels kinda cyberpunk and I finally got a fuckin normal sleep schedule.</p>
