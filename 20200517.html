      <h4>2020/05/17 - Maybe putting this on Github Pages</h4>
      <p>I'm thinking about moving this to GitHub, since it would be easier to update it, justing pulling and merging, don't know about it, I have to figure out how does git work from emacs, should be easy. Just started using emacs (spacemacs, actually, since I'm used to vim shortcuts), liking it so far. Instead of Neuromancer, I'm reading K&R C, really enjoying the exercises, and also really enjoying how my mind is adapted to this kind of thinking somehow.</p>
